# Mixins

Here you'll find SASS mixins we believe are usefull. They begin with an underscore and end on `.scss`, so you can copy them directly into your [nikita.kickstarter](https://github.com/nikita-kit/nikita-kickstarter) mixins-folder.


## Contents

### Centering

This mixin is used for horizontally and/or vertically centering elements.


### Fixed Ratiobox

This mixin uses intrinsic ratio to force any child elements to fluidly scale at a given ratio, including videos and frames, making awesome responsive happiness. :)


### Font-Smoothing

This mixin is used for better font-rendering on OS X, because due to its sub-pixel antialiasing algorithm OS X tends to render light text on dark backgrounds too bold.


### Layering

This function is used for managing z-index layers within a Sass map.


### px to rem

This mixin converts pixel values to rem values for whatever property is passed to it.


### Respond-To

This mixin is used for managing your media queries.


### Triangle
